# Prithvi-Fine-Tuned-Global-Health

This repository provides implementations which extends the Prithvi MAE remote sensing foundation model from the paper ["Foundation Models for Generalist Geospatial Artificial Intelligence", Jakubik et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18660).

The code for the Prthivi model was cloned from this repo ["isaaccorley / prithvi-pytorch"](https://github.com/isaaccorley/prithvi-pytorch).
