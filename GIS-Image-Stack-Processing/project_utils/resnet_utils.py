    """
        Instantiates a ResNet-18 model for regression tasks, optionally fine-tuning specific layers and extracting features.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        output_features : int, optional (default=1)
            The number of output features for the final fully connected layer, typically used for regression tasks.
        extraction_layer : str, optional
            The layer from which features will be extracted. It can be a high-level layer (e.g., 'layer3', 'layer4') or a specific sub-layer.
        fine_tune_layers : int, optional (default=0)
            Number of high-level layers to fine-tune starting from the deepest. For example, setting `fine_tune_layers=2` will fine-tune 'layer4' and 'layer3'.
        dropout_rate : float, optional (default=0.5)
            Dropout rate for the fully connected layer to prevent overfitting.
        features_list : list, optional
            A list to store the extracted features. If None, an empty list will be initialized.

        --------
        model_res_18 : torch.nn.Module
            The ResNet-18 model configured for regression, with optional layers set to be fine-tuned.
        features_list : list
            A list containing feature maps extracted from the specified extraction layer during forward passes.

        Notes:
        ------
        - The model is loaded with ImageNet pre-trained weights (`ResNet18_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1`).
        - By default, all layers are frozen except for those specified for fine-tuning and the final fully connected (fc) layer.
        - If an extraction layer is specified, a hook is set to capture the output of that layer during forward propagation.
        - Dropout is added before the final fully connected layer to reduce overfitting risk.

        A list of cluster labels to be assigned to the respective cluster IDs.

    Returns:
    --------
    pandas.DataFrame

    Notes:
    ------
    - If the 'cluster_label' column already exists in the DataFrame, the function will skip the assignment.
    - If any cluster labels are missing after merging, a warning will be printed indicating the number of missing labels.

    --------
    updated_df = assign_cluster_labels_by_matching(geospatial_df, cluster_ids, cluster_labels)
